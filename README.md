# WhatsApp Web Custom Background Changer for Firefox

This extension lets you **customize the background image** of your WhatsApp Web chats.  
With it, you can set any image as the chat background, adjust its opacity, and have your settings saved automatically so they persist across sessions.

## ✨ Features

- 📂 **Upload your own image** to use as chat background.
- 🖼️ **Automatic compression & resizing** to keep things smooth (images scaled down to 1200px width and optimized).
- 🎚️ **Adjust background opacity** directly from the context menu.
- 💾 **Persistent settings**: your chosen background and opacity are saved in your browser storage.
- 🔄 **Auto-applies** when switching chats or reloading WhatsApp Web.
- ⚡ **Seamless integration**: the option to change the background is injected directly into the WhatsApp chat context menu.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. When you **right-click inside a chat**, a new option appears:  
   → **"Change Background Image"**
2. From there you can:
   - Upload a new image (compressed and resized automatically).
   - Adjust the background **opacity** (0% – fully transparent, 100% – fully visible).
3. Your background remains active even after refreshing WhatsApp Web or switching chats.
4. If you want to change it back to the default background, just reset it!
